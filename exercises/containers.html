# Lesson 1: Container Says 'Ciao!'
![Docker](../media/docker/small_v-trans.png)

---
# Task 1: Get a container running
  1. run container using `realestate/ciao` image
  2. run container as a daemon(in 'detached' mode)
  3. name your container
  4. list running containers
  5. list ALL containers
  6. run bash shell on your container. Modify something in the container, eg. create a new file. Will the changes persist the next time you run container again?
  7. remove all stopped containers. How do you remove a container as soon as it's stopped?

# Task 2: Expose container port
  1. map container port 80 to host port 5678

]

  2. can you get a greeting from container?
  3. expose container port on random host port
  4. how to find the random host port?

# Lesson 2: Logs
![Docker](../media/docker/small_v-trans.png)

---
# Task: Get logs for running container
  1. display log messages from container (where do you think docker collects the log from?)
  2. how to get logs with timestamps

# Lesson 3: Change the container greeting
![Docker](../media/docker/small_v-trans.png)

---
# Task: Change the container's `MESSAGE` environment variable
1. The application's greeting message is stored in the MESSAGE environment variable (see [here](https://github.com/realestate-com-au/intro-to-docker/blob/gh-pages/exercises/ciao/index.js#L5)). Set your own greeting for your container.

```javascript
var MESSAGE = (process.env.MESSAGE || "Ciao mondo.");
```

# Lesson 4: Inter-Container networking - proxy your app container
.center[ <img src="../diagrams/shared-network.png" width="80%" /> ]

---
# Task 1: create a docker network called 'shared'
  1. create network; confirm by getting a list of docker networks. What other networks can you see?

### Useful refs: 
- https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#network-settings
- https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/network_create/

---
# Task 2: run 2 containers in the 'shared' network
  1. assign container running 'realestate/ciao' image the name 'app'
  2. assign container running 'realestate/ciao-proxy' image the name 'proxy'
  3. expose port on 'proxy' container
  
  **N.B.: There *must* be a container named 'app' for this to work.**

---
# Task 3: explore the network
  1. Find the assigned IPs of the `app` and `proxy` containers.

# Lesson 5: Attaching Volumes to containers
![Docker](../media/docker/small_v-trans.png)

---
# Task 1: Make a directory in your host available to the container at /myhome using a bind mount to host directory
  1. start a container with a bind mount. Make sure to attach a bash shell to container by overriding container's default command with 'bash'
  2. verify that you have read/write access to the directory
  3. verify that the changes made in /myhome persists after the container is stopped
  4. what are the pros and cons of using bind mounts?

### Useful refs:

- https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/
- https://docs.docker.com/storage/

---
# Task 2: Create a volume for storing data.
  1. create a volume called 'data', and run a container that mounts the volume in /myhome
  2. modify /myhome. stop and start another container that mounts the volume in /myhome (or a different one!). verify the changes persisted
  3. why are volumes preferred over bind mounts?
  4. start a container using --rm (to remove it as soon as it's stopped) with an anonymouse volume (mount it in /scratch), and make a change in /scratch. What will happen to the volume as soon as the container is stopped? 
  5. when would you want to use an anonymous volume?

---
# Task 3: Create a volume to share with another container
  1. create 2 containers that mounts the 'data' volume. verify on each container that any modifications made to the volume are visible on both containers
